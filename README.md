# NOTES:

When developing: follow 80/20. If it takes 80% of your time to develop and automate something that provides only 20% values, drop it and implement `terminal`.

# Main Flow

## Farm hashtags

1. Start the application
-- app starts and opens up the browsers
-- app prompts you several accounts with usernames and passwords to use to login
2. Login to Instagram
3. Confirm on app. Begin 5 second countdown before hashtag farming begins
-- app begins farming hashtags around a certain niche
-- interactions with the terminal can occur to change the queue? << FUTURE UPGRADE >>

## Farm users & niches

TBD
